# Clojure Quotes Bot

This is a small toy program, that delivers quotes from
[the Clojure Quotes repo](https://github.com/Azel4231/clojure-quotes)
to the Telegram Instant Messaging App and Discord

You can add the bot on Telegram: [Clojure Quotes (@cljqbot)](https://telegram.me/cljqbot)  
Or you can [add the bot to your Discord server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=733710171599143002&permissions=0&scope=bot).

At the moment I have to manually restart the bot when it's no longer working,
so don't worry if it does not react to your commands immediately. :)
