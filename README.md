This is a small bot for Discord and Telegram, which delivers quotes from [the Clojure Quotes repo](https://github.com/Azel4231/clojure-quotes).

[**Click here to add the bot to a Discord server**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=733710171599143002&permissions=0&scope=bot)

[**Click here to add the bot on Telegram (_@cljqbot_)**](https://telegram.me/cljqbot)

## Using the bot

To get a quote on Discord, just mention the bot using `@`.  
For a quote on Telegram, write the command `/quote` in the chat.

## Important note

In case the bot crashes, I currently have to restart it manually. So please don't be sad when the bot doesn't respond on some days.
